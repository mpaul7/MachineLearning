### Algorithm Tuning
* Grid Search Parameter Tuning
* Random Search Parameter Tuning

Algorithm tuning is a final step in the process of applied machine learning before finalizing your
model. It is sometimes called hyperparameter optimization where the algorithm parameters
are referred to as hyperparameters, whereas the coefficients found by the machine learning
algorithm itself are referred to as parameters.
